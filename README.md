# Bank of FlatIron!

# Description

This is the project made for the fourth challenge for Moringa School.

In this project is a website in which a user can:

- See a table of transactions

-  Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table

-  Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.
